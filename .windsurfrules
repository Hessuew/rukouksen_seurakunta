# rukouksen_seurakunta

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

The official website of the Prayer church.

- Objectives: Provide a single source of truth for all the content of the church
- Target audience: Members and visitors of the church
- Key features:
  - Easy navigation
  - Easy to search
  - Easy to read
  - Great UI/UX

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure repository files as follows:

```
├── src/
    ├── assets/         # favicon, images, and tailwind styles
    ├── components/     # Shared Astro components
    ├── content/        # Blog related content
    ├── data/           # Data for different pages
    ├── layouts/        # Shared layout components
    ├── pages/         # Route pages
    ├── utils/         # Helper functions
    ├── config         # Shared configuration
    ├── navigation     # Navigation of the website
    ├── types.d.ts     # Types of the website
    └── tests/         # Unit and integration tests
```

## Tech Stack

- Astro
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Bun

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files ~/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI and Styling

- Use existing components when possible
- Create new components when necessary
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use semantic color variables for theming
- Ensure smooth transitions and animations

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Provide alt text for images

## Git Usage

We use Graphite The AI-powered pull request toolchain.

Users will themselves create branches with descriptive names that reflect the changes. When committing:

1. Give a good commit message
2. Use and fill the existing pull request template .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
   2.1 Don't remove unchecked checkboxes
3. Always check all related files when creating a PR, not just the active file
4. Include both technical and visual changes in PR descriptions
5. Group changes by component/page for better organization
6. Reference specific UI/UX improvements made

## Documentation

- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Keep manifest.json well-documented
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
- Follow Keep a Changelog format (https://keepachangelog.com)
- Include version, date, and categorized changes

## Development Workflow

- Use proper version control
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain changelog, when version is updated in changelog update version in package.json

## Notes

- If you are asked to fix something, start with analyzing what files you need in context and ask the user for them, do not make assumptions.
- Make self-improving updates to the .windsurfrules file.
