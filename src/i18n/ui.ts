    'testimonialMahi.t2': `
Praise be to God! <br /><br />

I'm not sure how to explain what happened without first telling you what was happening before. I am a Christian—well, my parents were Christians—but I never truly believed until I was about 21 or 22 years old. Then, I understood Jesus. The way I came to believe in Christ is a long story, but it was a miraculous moment for me. <br /><br />

After that, I developed a deep and intimate relationship with God. That was when I was at university, studying. I had this relationship with God and the Holy Spirit, which I was introduced to through the baptism of the Holy Spirit in a special way. This intimate relationship with God lasted for three years. <br /><br />

Then, through a series of events, I was heartbroken—both personally and with the church I was attending at the time. Satan used that situation to drive me away from the church, and I was on my own for six years or more. I was going through a period where I first wanted to forget about God and the relationship I had with Him, which I deeply missed. <br /><br />

After a few years, I started formulating my own theories about life—how to survive, how to make it on my own, and things like that. Over the past year, everything suddenly became so difficult that I realized it was foolish to think I could make it on my own, that I could live without God. I saw the people around me appearing to live their lives successfully without Him, but that was a lie. <br /><br />

Because I once had that relationship with God, I felt as if life was slowly draining out of me, drop by drop. I was suffocating. Over the past few months, the strong resistance I had within myself—the fight not to return to God—started manifesting physically. I became exhausted, started experiencing physical pain, and was in and out of the hospital. I even had to get an MRI to see what was wrong with me, but there was nothing physically wrong. <br /><br />

Even my husband started thinking it might be psychological. But in truth, it wasn’t psychological—it was spiritual. Even painkillers stopped working for me, and I had been unable to sleep for many months. Strangely, my husband, who isn’t a very spiritual person, started suspecting that this could be a spiritual issue. He even joked that I was under some kind of attack. <br /><br />

Then, he started encouraging me to go to church. Before, whenever I suggested going to church, we would just joke about it, knowing it wouldn’t happen. But this time, he strongly urged me to go every Sunday. <br /><br />

As I mentioned last time, I wanted to go to a Bible study group to see what was going on, but I never had the courage or strength. Then, last week, I woke up in the morning and prayed. Well, actually, I just knelt down and thought about this prayer meeting. I asked God, "Why do I feel this fear? What is the source of it?" <br /><br />

For a moment, I even wondered if God didn’t want me to go to this meeting. But then I thought—if that were true, and I still went, how would that be any different from any other day when I ignored what God was telling me? So, I decided to go and see what would happen. <br /><br />

When I arrived, Maria was giving her testimony. Her words, in some way, confirmed to me that I was in the right place. Immediately, I felt the Spirit of God so strongly—I was shaking and trembling the entire time. Then, we prayed, and Yani shared the Word of God, which spoke directly to me. <br /><br />

In the middle of the Bible study, he asked me to introduce myself. I said, "My name is Mahi, and I've been trying to come to this place for ten months." That’s when Andrew stopped everything and said, "We need to pray." <br /><br />

A few seconds later, I felt the Spirit of God—angry and ready to attack whoever had been attacking me for so long. Everyone prayed. Andrew prayed about my health, which he didn’t even know about, about my family issues, and about a generational curse—which is another long story. This past week, God has been revealing more details about that curse. <br /><br />

Also, AA joined us online. She had a vision of me being bound, as if I were caught in a net like a fish, and she said I had been like that for a long time. But as we prayed, she saw the net being dismantled. I was becoming freer and starting to move. That vision deeply touched me. Now, I realize—she said I was curled up like a baby in a womb. That position, that chain, I now believe was the source of my pain. It was a pain I couldn’t pinpoint. <br /><br />

As we prayed, I was freed. The Spirit of God touched me powerfully. I cried. A few minutes later, I was overwhelmed with joy. Jesus had done it again! He had freed me again and saved me from Satan’s hold—again! And when I say "again," I don’t mean just a second time. This has been a long history of bondage, but there I was—free. <br /><br />

At the end of the Bible study, we prayed over the words spoken that night. I prayed, "God, if I leave this meeting and go home, You need to restore the Holy Spirit to me. If I go home and I can’t pray in tongues, then I won’t have the power to pray, and this will all happen again. It needs to happen tonight." <br /><br />

Then, at the end, Andrew came up to me and asked, "Have you ever prayed in tongues?" <br /><br />

I replied, "I used to, but over time, it faded away." <br /><br />

So, we prayed, and right then and there, I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit again. Everything was restored. I left that night as a joyful person, jumping in the streets—praise be to God! <br /><br />

Since then, every day, God has been teaching me new things—things I had never learned before. He’s been inspiring me to reach out to my family and remind them of Christ. Very soon, I expect to hear testimonies from them too. <br /><br />

Amen! Praise be to God!

It is a place of divine encounters and transformative experiences.`,
    'testimonialCJ.t2': `
And glory to God! I want to bless the name of the Lord for His faithfulness this year. <br /><br />

For the few times I have been part of the fellowships here—both the prayer meeting, the Bible study, and the Sunday gathering—I think I have attended each of these meetings twice. I didn’t necessarily intend to say much, but the truth is, there is a kind of call to revival in my life. <br /><br />

When I was coming to Finland, one of the prayers my family and I sincerely made was for the Lord to lead us to a body of Christ that would keep our faith aflame. When we arrived, we found a fellowship and joined. But instead of experiencing growth and the joy that comes from spiritual fulfillment, we found ourselves going downward. <br /><br />

It’s not that we started committing one sin or another, but I could literally feel that life was leaving me. I began searching for a place where I could be spiritually refreshed. It became such a big concern that I even called home to share my worries with a few people. <br /><br />

Then, I heard about the UEF Bible Club, and I also found a leaflet in my mailbox. It wasn’t easy for me to participate until very recently. My first participation was on the 18th of January. When I attended, I felt God’s presence. A lot of things started coming alive in me again—spiritual songs began returning to my memory, scriptures I had forgotten started coming back. These were scriptures that had seemed to erode away during the two years I had been in Finland. <br /><br />

Before, I was merely existing—not really living according to my calling or purpose. I was just going through the motions like everyone else. But that was never the desire of my heart from the moment I made the decision to come here. <br /><br />

I have now come to discover that the Spirit of God is truly in this place. For me, I would rather stay, settle, and be part of what God is doing. I want to immerse myself fully in the revival that God is bringing into my life. <br /><br />

I deeply appreciate this gathering because, since coming to Finland, this is the first time I have been able to sit in a spiritual program for more than two hours and not feel tired. Instead, I feel joyful at the end of the meetings. <br /><br />

Another thing that seemed like a mystery to me has now been demystified in this gathering. From what people had said, I never believed I could be in the midst of some original Finns—something truly filled with the Holy Ghost—and experience this kind of fellowship. <br /><br />

So, it became a sign to me that God is in this place, and it is the desire of my heart to soak in everything that God has prepared for me here. It truly feels like revival, and I desire it to continue in my life. <br /><br />

I know that testimonies will come from this—great testimonies—and in due time, I will share them. For now, I am simply enjoying the atmosphere of this fellowship, and God is bringing revival into my life.

    I shared my life story of new-age spirituality, occultism, meditation, yoga, depression, how I lost my health, mental health, money, family, and my will to live, and how I finally found Jesus, the great Savior. After this, I was asked if I had been filled with the Holy Spirit since giving my life to Jesus. My response was no. <br /> <br />

The Prayer Church prayed for me, and suddenly, I started hearing voices inside me saying, 'Get out of this place quickly.' At first, I was shocked to realize that several voices were speaking within me, but I refused to leave. <br /> <br />

Then, the power of God fell on me mightily, and I began to shake vigorously under the anointing of the Holy Ghost. I lost consciousness during the process—my tongue fell out of my mouth, and I was knocked backward without anyone touching me. It was just like in the Bible when Jesus cast out devils, and those being delivered would react violently. <br /> <br />

I could hear the evil spirits and demons inside me speaking to each other, saying, 'We have to leave now; we cannot stay any longer.' After about 10 minutes, they all left. My hands lifted unconsciously, and I wept uncontrollably, thanking Jesus for my complete deliverance. Freedom at last! <br /> <br />

After this great encounter, the Prayer Church brethren prayed for me again, and Jesus baptized me with the Holy Spirit. I began speaking in tongues, and it was a glorious and unforgettable experience. Hallelujah!

Did you see what happened to me when we prayed? Well, as we prayed, I started yawning immensely. I tried to cover my mouth and hold my jaw, but the relentless yawning persisted. It felt as though something was being forced out of me, escaping through my mouth. This continued for several minutes until, finally, the last of it left. <br /> <br />

I opened my eyes and saw that everyone in the prayer church was praying with their eyes closed. I was astonished at what was happening to me, especially since nobody there knew my life story—this was my very first visit to the church. <br /> <br />

Since childhood, I had been introduced to occultism, and it had impacted my life for over 70 years. Satan tormented me relentlessly, afflicting me with severe mental struggles, anxiety, and panic attacks. <br /> <br />

But now, I know I have been set free from all the oppression that had crippled my life. It is truly shocking to realize that evil spirits had tormented me for 70 long years. Isn’t that incredible? <br /> <br />

I was involved in nature and light therapy. I added new-age spirituality and set up a company to assist people with mental problems, stress, and anxiety.  <br /><br />

Unfortunately, I started having extremely disturbing nightmares. I was attacked by Satan and tormented by snakes. No matter how much I tried to follow all the rules of the Dark Age and spirituality, the situation worsened. This affected my life and family.  <br /><br />

I sold my soul to Satan, and a dragon entered into me and wanted to kill me on my living room sofa. In utter desperation, I screamed, "Jesus!" and the dragon loosed its grip on me.  <br /><br />

In desperation, I found the Prayer Church, where I was prayed for, and immediately, I was delivered from all the oppressions of demons. I was thereafter filled with the Holy Spirit, with the evidence of speaking in tongues.  <br /><br />

Great changes occurred in my life within one week—everything changed! I shut down the company I had set up for Satan, and I began to preach the gospel and set people free from demons when I prayed for them.  <br /><br />

There were immediate signs as demons left people. It is amazing that I have been delivered to deliver others.  <br /><br />

Ylitys Jumalalle!  <br /><br />

En ole varma miten selittäisin, mitä minulle tapahtui, ennen kuin olen selittänyt, mitä minulle tapahtui aiemmin. Olen kristitty—tai minun vanhempani olivat kristittyjä—mutta minä en uskonut oikeasti ennen kuin oli 21 tai 22 vuotta vanha. Sitten ymmärsin todella, kuka Jeesus on. Se miten aloin uskomaan Jeesukseen on pitkä tarina, mutta tuo hetki oli minulle ihmeellinen hetki. <br /><br />

Tuon jälkeen minulle kehittyi syvä ja intiimi suhde Jumalaan. Olin tuolloin opiskelemassa yliopistossa. Minulle oli elävä suhde Jumalaan ja Pyhään Henkeen johon pääsin Pyhän Hengen kasteen kautta, joka oli myös ihmeellinen kokemus. Tämä intiimi suhde jatkui kolme vuotta. <br /><br />

Tuon jälkeen useiden tapahtuneiden asioiden vaikutuksen kautta sydämeni oli murtunut—henkilökohtaisista asioista ja myös sen seurakunnan takia, jossa kävin tuolloin—ja oli sitten kuusi vuotta kaukana Jumalasta. Tuona aikana halusin unohtaa Jumalan ja myös suhteen, joka minulle oli ollut Hänen kanssaan, vaikka samalla ikävöin todella paljon tuota suhdetta. <br /><br />

Muutaman vuoden jälkeen minulle kehittyi omia teorioita elämästä—miten selvitä, miten selvitä omillani ja niin edelleen. Viime vuoden aikana kaikki muuttui yhtäkkiä niin vaikeaksi, että ymmärsin ajatusten, että pärjäisin omillani ja ilman Jumalaa, olevan täysin hölmöjä. Ympärilläni olevat ihmiset näyttivät elävän menestyksekkäitä elämiä ilman Häntä, mutta se ei ollut totta.  <br /><br />

Sen takia, että minulla oli ollut todellinen suhde Jumalaan aiemmin, minusta tuntui kuin elämä oli pikkuhiljaa valunut minusta ylös tippa tipalta. Minä tukehduin. Muutaman viimeisen kuukauden aikana tuo sisälläni oleva valtava vastustus, etten palaisi takaisin Jumalan luokse, alkoi ilmetä fyysisinä oireina. Olin täysin uupunut, aloin kärsiä kivusta ja vierailin sairaalassa uudelleen ja uudelleen. Minulle tehtiin myös magneettikuvaus sen selvittämiseksi, mikä oli vialla, mutta fyysisesti olin täysin kunnossa. <br /><br />

Jopa mieheni alkoi ajatella, että ongelma oli psykologinen. Mutta todellisuudessa ongelma ei ollut psykologinen, vaan hengellinen. Edes särkylääkkeet eivät toimineet enää kipuuni ja en ollut nukkunut lähes ollenkaan moneen kuukauteen. Sitten tapahtui eräs kummallinen asia: mieheni, joka ei ole kovin hengellinen henkilö, alkoi epäillä, että ongelma oli hengellinen. Hän jopa vitsaili, että olisin jonkinlaisen hyökkäyksen alla. <br /><br />

Sen jälkeen hän alkoi rohkaista minua menemään seurakuntaan. Aiemmin, kun olin tuonut esille itse, että saattaisin mennä kirkkoon, hän vain vitsaili siitä ja tiesi, etten kuitenkaan menisi. Mutta nyt hän rohkaisi todella vahvasti, että menisin joka sunnuntaina. <br /><br />

Halusin mennä käymään (UEF )Raamattukerhossa nähdäkseni, mitä siellä tapahtui, mutta minulta puuttui rohkeus ja voima siihen. Viime viikolla sitten heräsin aamulla ja rukoilin. Tai oikeastaan minä vain polvistuin ja mietin tuota rukoustapaamista. Kysyin Jumalalta, "Miksi tunnen pelkoa? Mistä se tulee?" <br /><br />

Mietin jopa hetken aikaa, ettei Jumala olisi halunnut minun tulevan tähän tapaamiseen. Mutta sitten ajattelin, että jos tuo ajatus olisikin totta ja silti menisin, niin että se ei eroaisi millään tavoin jokaisesta päivästä, jolloin en välittänyt Jumalan äänestä. Joten päätin että menen ja näen itse, mitä siellä tapahtuu. <br /><br />

Kun saavuin paikalle Maria jakoi todistustaan. Hänen sanansa jotenkin vakuuttivat minut, että olin oikeassa paikassa. Tunsin heti voimakkaan Pyhän Hengen läsnäolon; vapisin ja tärisin koko tapaamisen ajan. Sitten rukoilimme ja Juhani jakoi Jumalan sanaa, joka puhutteli minua suoraan. <br /><br />

Raamatun käsittelyn keskellä Juhani kysyi, että voisinko esitellä itseni. Sanoin, "Nimeni on Mahi ja olen yrittänyt tulla tänne 10 kuukautta." Silloin Andrew pysäytti kaiken ja sanoin, "Meidän pitää rukoilla."  <br /><br />

Tunsin muutamassa sekunnissa Pyhän Hengen olevan vihainen sille, joka oli hyökännyt minua kohtaan näin pitkään hengellisesti, ja myös hyökäävän nyt tätä vastaan. Kaikki rukoilivat. Andrew rukoili terveyteni puolesta, josta hän ei tiennyt, perheongelmieni puolesta ja myös sukupolvet ylittävästä kirouksesta—joka on oma pitkä tarinansa, tällä viikolla Jumala on paljastanut minulle lisää yksityiskohtia tuosta kirouksesta. <br /><br />

Myös Ida oli mukana Zoomin kautta. Hän näki näyn, jossa minä olin jumissa verkossa kuten kala ja hän sanoi, että olin ollut noin jo pitkään. Mutta kun rukoilimme hän näki kun verkko alkoi purkautua. Aloin vapautua ja liikkua. Näky kosketti minua syvästi. Ymmärrän nyt sen, että kun Ida kertoi minun olevan kerällä kuin kohdussa oleva vauva, että tuo asento tai kahle oli kipuni lähde. Kipu jota en osannut paikallistaa. <br /><br />

Kun rukoilimme minä vapauduin. Pyhä Henki kosketti minua voimakkaasti. Minä itkin. Muutaman minuutin päästä täytyin ylitsevuotavasti ilolla. Jeesus oli tullut elämääni uudelleen! Hän vapautti minut ja pelasti minut Saatanan loukusta uudelleen! Ja kun sanon 'uudelleen' en tarkoita vaan toista kertaa. Kyseessä oli pitkä orjuus, mutta nyt tuolla hetkellä minä olin vapaa. <br /><br />

Tapaamisen lopussa rukoilimme sen pohjalta, mitä Raamatusta oli avautunut meille. Rukoilin, "Jumala, jos lähden tästä tapaamisesta ja menen kotiin, sinun täytyy palauttaa Pyhä Henki minulle. Jos menen kotiin enkä voi rukoilla kielillä niin sitten minulla ei ole voimaa rukoilla ja kaikki tuo aiempi paha tapahtuu minulle uudelleen. Minä tarvitsen Pyhän Hengen täyteyden tänään." <br /><br />

Sitten lopussa Andrew tuli luokseni ja kysyi, "Oletko ikinä rukoillut kielillä?" <br /><br />

Vastasin, "Kyllä ennen, mutta ajan kuluessa se hiipui pois." <br /><br />

Joten me rukoilimme jolloin siinä ja silloin koin Pyhän Hengen kasteen uudelleen. Jeesus oli palauttanut minulle kaikki. Lähdin tuona iltana tapaamisesta täynä iloa ja hyppeleskelin kaduilla—ylistys Jumalalle! <br /><br />

Tuon jälkeen Jumala on opettanut minulle uusia asioita joka päivä—sellaisia asioita, joita en ole tiennyt ikinä aiemmin. Hän inspiroi minut ottamaan yhteyttä perheeseeni ja muistuttamaan heitä Kristuksesta. Odotan, että kuulen pian myös heiltä todistuksia. <br /><br />

Aamen! Ylistys Jumalalle!

On ihmeellistä todeta että kokoontumisemme ikäänkuin ruumillistavat Siionin—elävän Jumalan kaupungin, jossa lukematon määrä enkeleitä kokoontuu (Hep 12:22). Tämä on yliluonnollisten kohtaamisten paikka, jossa elämät muuttuvat.`,
    'testimonialCJ.t2': `
Haluan siunata Herran nimeä, sillä Hän on ollut hyvin uskollinen minua kohtaan tänä vuonna. <br /><br />

Olen ollut mukana muutaman kerran rukouskokouksessa, Raamiksessa ja sunnuntain tapaamisessa, uskoakseni kaikissa kokouksissa kaksi kertaa. En ajatellut sanovani paljon, mutta totta puhuakseni elämässäni on tapahtunut herätys. <br /><br />

Kun tulimme perheeni kanssa Suomeen yksi vilpitön rukouksemme oli, että Herra johtaisi Kristuksen ruumiin osaan, joka pitäisi tulemme palavana. Saavuimme ja löysimme seurakunnan ja aloimme käymään siellä. Mutta sen sijaan, että olisimme kasvaneet hengessä ja kokeneet sitä iloa, joka syntyy Hengen täyteydestä, hengellinen elämämme alkoi taantua. <br /><br />

Emme alkaneet tekemään joitain syntejä, mutta kirjaimellisesti tunsin, että elämää poistui minusta. Aloin etsimään paikkaa, jossa hengellinen elämäni voisi virvoittua. Asiasta tuli minulle  niin iso huoli, että soitin takaisin kotimaahani kertoakseni siitä muutamalle henkilölle. <br /><br />

Sen jälkeen kuulin UEF Raamattukerhosta ja lisäksi löysin esitteen postilaatikostani. En kuintenkaan pystynyt osallistumaan kuin aivan vasta. Olin paikalla ensimmäistä kertaa 18:sta Tammikuuta. Tunsin Jumalan läsnäolon. Elämäni alkoi tulla uudelleen eloon; hengelliset laulut alkoivat palautua muistiini ja Raamatun paikat, jotka olin unohtanut, alkoivat myös palautua. Jotenkin nuo kirjoitukset olivat kuin kuihtuneet pois minusta noiden kahden vuoden aikana, jotka oli ollut Suomessa. <br /><br />

Tuona aikana minä olin vain olemassa; en täyttänyt kutsumustani tai tarkoitustani. Elin vain arjen keskellä niin kuin kuka tahansa ihminen ilman mitään syvempää merkitystä. Tuo ei kuitenkaan ollut ikinä ollut se mitä tahdoin kokea Suomessa. <br /><br />

Olen nyt nähnyt, että Jumalan Henki on todella tässä paikassa. Henkilökohtaisesti haluan pysyä, asettua ja olla osa sitä, mitä Jumala tekee. Haluan uppoutua täysin tähän herätykseen, jonka Jumala on tuonut elämääni. <br /><br />

Arvostan tätä tapaamista todella paljon sillä tultuani Suomeen tämä on ensimmäinen kerta kun voin olla hengellisessä tapaamisessa yli kaksi tuntia enkä koe olevani yhtään väsynyt. Sen sijaan olen täynä iloa jokaisen kokouksen jälkeen. <br /><br />

Myös toinen asia, joka oli minulle aiemmin mysteeri, on avautunut näissä kokoontumissa minulle. Sen pohjalta, mitä olen kuullut ihmisiltä, en uskonut että voisin koskaan olla keskellä suomalaisia, jotka ovat todella täynä Pyhää Henkeä ja kokea tämän kaltaista yhteyttä. <br /><br />

Tästä tuli minulle merkki, että Jumala on tässä paikassa ja sydämeni halu on upottoautua kaikkeen siihen, mitä Jumala on valmistanut minun varalleni. Tämä todella tuntuu herätykseltä ja haluan sen jatkuvan elämässäni. <br /><br />

Tiedän, että elämässäni syntyy tämän pohjalta uusia todistuksia, suuria todistuksia, ja tulen pian jakamaan ne. Mutta nyt minä yksinkertaisesti nautin tästä ilmapiiristä ja yhteydestä ja tästä Jumalan elämääni tuomasta herätyksestä. <br /><br />

Sen jälkeen Jumalan voima tuli voimakkaasti päälleni ja aloin heilua ja täristä todella paljon Pyhän Hengen voitelun alla. En tiennyt mitä kaikkea minulle tapahtuu—kieleni 'putosi' ulos suustani ja minut heitettiin taaksepäin ilman, että kukaan koski minua. Tilanne oli kuin Raamatussa, kun Jeesus ajoi ulos pahoja henkiä ja kun nuo henkilöt, jotka vapautuivat, reagoivat joskus hyvin voimakkaasti. <br /> <br />

Kuulin pahojen henkien ja demonien puhuvan sisälläni toisilleen ja sanovan, 'Meidän täytyy lähteä nyt; emme voi pysyä täällä pidempään.' Noin 10 minuutin päästä ne kaikki lähtivät. Nostin tiedostamatta käteni taivasta kohti, itkin paljon ja kiitin Jeesusta, koska Hän oli vapauttanut minut täysin. Vihdoinkin vapaus! <br /> <br />

Tämän mahtavan vapautumisen jälkeen Rukouksen seurakunnan jäsenet rukoilivat uudelleen puolestani ja Jeesus upotti minut Pyhään Henkeen. Aloin puhua vieraalla kielellä ja se oli loistava ja unohtumaton kokemus. Halleluja!

Sen jälkeen täytyin siellä Pyhällä Hengellä kielillä puhumisen merkein. Elämässäni alkoi tapahtua suuria muutoksia jo viikon aikana, ja koko elämäni muuttui.<br /> <br />
