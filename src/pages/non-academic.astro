      If you cannot answer these simple questions painstakingly and with ease, you haven't yet understood the
      fundamentals of life. You might be doing extraordinary research, be a big professor, and define the targets of
      huge funds. But if you cannot answer these fundamental questions, you have not yet reached the kindergarden of
      spirit.

      Physical things are temporary. Spiritual things are eternal. Focus on the spiritual things.
