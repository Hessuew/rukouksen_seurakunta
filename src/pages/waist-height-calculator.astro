      Acquire a flexible measuring tape or tape rule. Feel for your hip bone and your bottom rib, and place the tape measure
      evenly around your waist which is halfway between the last rib and hip bone. The waistline may lie directly above your
      umbilicus. (If needed, use a mirror to guide the tape straight around your waist and parallel to the ground.) Record
      the values in centimeters.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight dark:text-white sm:text-3xl mb-2">Height measurement</h3>
      A tape measure, a flat surface, and a pencil are needed. Stand with your feet without shoes flat on the floor with
      your heels against the corner where the wall and floor meet. Ensure your head, shoulders, and buttocks touch the wall.
      Look straight ahead parallel to the floor. Have someone place a book or a ruler over your head and lightly mark the
      wall with a pencil. Then measure the distance between the marked point and the floor. Now calculate waist circumference
      (cm)/height (cm) and check the results against the categories provided above.

      Waist circumference-to-height ratio had a very high agreement of 81 – 89% with DEXA-measured total body fat mass and
      trunk fat mass, but a low agreement with muscle mass (24 – 39%). BMI had a moderate agreement with total fat mass and
      trunk fat mass (65 – 72%) and muscle mass (52 – 58%). Since BMI had a moderate agreement with DEXA-measured muscle
      mass, it is difficult to specify whether BMI measures excess fat or muscle mass. The optimal waist circumference-to-height
      ratio cut points that predicted the 95th percentile of total fat mass in males was 0.53 and 0.54 in females. This cut
      point detected 8 out of 10 males and 7 out of 10 females who truly had excess DEXA-measured fat. The cut point also
      identified 93 out of 100 males and 95 out of 100 females who truly do not have excess fat A treasusubtitle='Waist circumference-to-height

      “This study provides novel information that would be useful in updating future childhood obesity guidelines and policy
      statements. The average waist circumference-to-height ratio in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is 0.45,
      it does not vary with age and among individuals like BMI. Waist circumference-to-height ratio might be preferable to
      BMI assessment in children and adolescent clinics as an inexpensive tool for detecting excess fat. Parents should not
      be discouraged by the BMI or weight of their children but can inexpensively confirm whether the weight is due to increase
      in excess fat by examining their kid’s waist circumference-to-height ratio.”
